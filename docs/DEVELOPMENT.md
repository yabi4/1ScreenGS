# Development

Everything needed to rebuild, extend or debug the patch. Read
[FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) alongside this — it holds the reverse-engineering results
(addresses, what each one is, and the dead ends).

## Layout

```
patch.py              user-facing CLI
patch-gui.py          user-facing window (tkinter); tools/build_exe.py freezes it
onescreen/            the patcher itself - no devkitARM needed
  sites.py            finds and rewrites POWCNT1 display-routing sites
  table.py            which sites to flip, which to leave alone
  inject.py           ITCM autoload block + checked main/evolution task hooks
  rom.py              load / verify / patch / repack
  payload/            pre-assembled hook.bin + hook.json (generated)
src/hook.s            the resident ARM/Thumb hook source
tools/                development toolchain - needs devkitARM, melonDS
docs/
```

The patcher ships a **pre-assembled** payload so end users need only Python. Rebuild it
after any change to `src/hook.s`:

```bash
python tools/make_payload.py
```

That regenerates `onescreen/payload/hook.bin` **and** `hook.json`. Never hand-edit the
JSON — an early hand-conversion put the load address 0xA00 bytes off, which silently
loaded the payload to the wrong place.

### The config block

The hook does not hardcode the addresses it reads. `OneScreen_Config` at the top of
`src/hook.s` holds fourteen of them, and the patcher fills it in from the ROM being patched
(`onescreen/regions.py` → `inject.fill_config`). The defaults compiled into the payload
are the French values, so an unconfigured payload still works there.

The resident code is entered from two verified ARM9 sites. The main-loop call at
`0x02000DB0` drives global routing, while the callback literal at `0x02075D04` wraps the
evolution SysTask so its mirrored Yes/No highlight is drawn after native input in the same
frame. `inject.py` checks the displaced call/pointer before changing either one.

**If you add or reorder a field, update `CONFIG_FIELDS` in `onescreen/inject.py` to
match** — the two are positional and nothing checks them against each other.

To confirm it landed, read the block over the GDB stub after patching; it sits at the
`OneScreen_Config` address in `hook.json`:

```bash
powershell -File tools/probe.ps1 -Addrs "0x01FF8628:14w"
```

## Prerequisites

| tool | why |
|---|---|
| Python 3.9+ and `ndspy` | ROM/overlay handling, BLZ (de)compression |
| [devkitARM](https://devkitpro.org/) | assembling `src/hook.s` |
| [melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) | testing, and its GDB stub for live probing |

`tools/*.ps1` are Windows PowerShell helpers; the Python tools are portable. Paths to
devkitARM are hardcoded near the top of `tools/make_payload.py` and `tools/inject.py`.

## Verifying a change

The patcher is deterministic, so the strongest check is that it reproduces a known-good
build byte-for-byte:

```bash
python patch.py roms/ipgf.nds -o build/check.nds
# compare SHA-1 against a build you have already tested in-game
```

Both `IPGF` and `IPKF` were verified this way against the tested v15 builds.

## Development toolchain (`tools/`)

Most of these expect an unpacked ROM tree, produced by:

```bash
python tools/unpack.py roms/ipgf.nds     # -> build/ipgf/{arm9_dec.bin,overlays/,modules.json}
```

| tool | what it is for |
|---|---|
| `unpack.py` | extract + BLZ-decompress ARM9 and all 129 overlays |
| `build.py` | dev build (same result as `patch.py`, but with flip selection flags) |
| `find_powcnt.py` | scan and classify every POWCNT1 reference |
| `xrefs.py` / `crossrefs.py` | who calls an address; calls that cross module boundaries |
| `peek.py` / `whichov.py` | read words by RAM address; identify which overlay is resident |
| `savestate.py` | **read and diff melonDS savestates** — see below |
| `compare_modules.py` | diff every module between two ROMs (how HG/SS similarity was measured) |
| `freespace.py`, `deadcode.py`, `checkfree.py` | free-space hunting (kept for the record; ITCM made them moot) |
| `find_template.py`, `find_loader.py` | OverlayManager templates, overlay loader hunting |
| `melonds_config.py` | bind melonDS keys, screen sizing, enable the GDB stub |
| `shot.ps1` | launch melonDS, send input, screenshot the window |
| `probe.ps1` | read DS memory over the GDB stub |
| `zoom.ps1`, `compare.ps1` | crop/scale captures, build before/after images |

### Live memory probing

```bash
python tools/melonds_config.py --keys --gdb true
powershell -File tools/probe.ps1 -Addrs "0x021D112C:2w,0x04000304:1w"
```

**The melonDS GDB stub accepts exactly one connection per emulator launch.** Reconnecting
always fails with `vMustReplyEmpty: timeout`. Drive the game to the state you want, then
probe once.

### Savestate diffing

Far more powerful than the GDB stub, and how the battle-phase variable was found.
`savestate.py` locates the 4 MB main-RAM block inside a melonDS savestate by searching for
the start of `arm9_dec.bin`, so no format parsing is needed.

```bash
python tools/savestate.py read  state.mln 0x021D112C 4
python tools/savestate.py diff  a.mln b.mln
python tools/savestate.py triangulate a.mln b.mln c.mln    # A and C alike, B different
python tools/savestate.py intersect --menu m1.mln m2.mln --exec e1.mln e2.mln
```

`intersect` is the one that works. **Two or three savestates from a single battle is not
evidence** — 68,535 bytes passed that test once and the cleanest-looking candidate was
still a coincidence. Use several *different* battles, and let the built-in filters drop
heap churn (values must be small, and the byte must be isolated rather than part of a
changing block).

## Adding a screen that lands on the wrong side

In rough order of preference:

1. **It has its own POWCNT1 site** — the scanner already found it; just decide its intent
   in `onescreen/table.py` (`FLIP`, `KEEP`, or `TOUCH`).
2. **It is a distinct app that sets routing on entry** — add
   `{app callback, desired routing}` to `app_table` in `src/hook.s`. Find the callback by
   probing `0x021D112C` while the screen is up.
3. **It is drawn inside another app** (like the overworld X menu) — there is no transition
   to detect, so drive it from the buttons the player already presses.

## Gotchas worth knowing

- Overlays share RAM bases, so a memory dump alone cannot tell you which one is loaded —
  use `whichov.py`.
- `0x02022D3E` must never be flipped: it is inside the game's shared display-select
  helper, so flipping it inverts the overworld too.
- Sub-screens opened from the battle menu re-assert the routing themselves, so a one-shot
  swap does not survive; the hook re-applies it every frame while the menu is up.
- Emulator input needs a real hold (~100 ms). Synthetic presses shorter than a frame are
  missed entirely, and a lost key-up leaves a direction stuck down forever.
