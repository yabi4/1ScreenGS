"""Rasterise the battle command labels from the ROM being patched.

The top-screen command menu draws real text - the game's own words, in the game's
own font, pulled out of the ROM at patch time. Nothing is hardcoded per language:
both the strings and the glyphs come from the dump, so a French build says
ATTAQUE / SAC / POKéMON / FUITE and an English one says FIGHT / BAG / POKéMON /
RUN without this file knowing which is which.

Everything here is offline. The hook does no text rendering at runtime - it
memcpys finished 4bpp tiles into the message window. That keeps the resident code
free of heap, font and MsgData plumbing, and lets the output be checked as a PNG
before the ROM is ever booted.

Where the data lives, and how it was confirmed
----------------------------------------------
Strings: NARC `a/0/2/7` (pret's NARC_msgdata_msg = 27), file 197 = msg_0197,
entries 924 FIGHT / 925 BAG / 926 POKEMON / 927 RUN
(src/battle/battle_input.c:1899-1912). Gen-IV message archives obfuscate both the
offset table and the text with the same two LCGs used everywhere in the series.

Font: NARC `a/0/1/6` (NARC_graphic_font = 16), file 1 - fontId 1 is what the
battle message box prints with, `AddTextPrinterParameterized(window, 1, ...)` in
BattleSystem_PrintBattleMessage (src/battle/battle_system.c:1421). ndspy's NARC
reader returns the five font files as empty, so this module parses BTAF/GMIF
itself; the archive's own file table gives 33101 bytes each.

Format (pret's struct FontHeader, src/font_data.c:15):

    u32 headerSize      16
    u32 widthDataStart  32592  == 16 + 509 * 64, which is the whole check
    u32 numGlyphs       509
    u8  fixedWidth, fixedHeight, glyphWidth, glyphHeight    16,16,2,2

so glyphs are 16x16 (GLYPHSHAPE_16x16), 64 bytes each: four 8x8 tiles of 2bpp at
+0x00 +0x10 +0x20 +0x30, placed TL, TR, BL, BR - the neighbour offsets in
DecompressGlyphTiles_FromPreloaded are +0x20 across and +0x40 down. Two bits per
pixel, most significant pair leftmost, high byte of each u16 first. One width byte
per glyph at widthDataStart. Glyph index is the character code minus one
(TryLoadGlyph, src/font_data.c:150).

Pixel values map to the message window's own palette, which is palette 11 of main
BG. Confirmed twice over: dumped live from 0x05000160 in a real battle, and stated
outright by pret's sFontInfos (src/font.c:28) as fgColor 1, bgColor 15,
shadowColor 2.
