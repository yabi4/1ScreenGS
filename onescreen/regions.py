"""Resolve the addresses the hook needs, per ROM.

Measured across French and US HeartGold:

* ARM9 **code** addresses are **identical**. The same anchors were found at the
  same addresses in both - the display-select helper body at `0x02022D40`, the
  soft-reset check at `0x02000DB8`, the main-loop tail at `0x02000E32` - and the
  name-entry app function at `0x02083140` is byte-identical.
* Only **data, BSS and overlay bases** move, and uniformly: US = FR − 0x20.
  (`static_bss_start`, `bss_end` and every overlay base all shift by the same
  amount, because the US static data section is 0x20 bytes smaller.)

So there is no per-region address table. Everything is derived from the ROM:

* the state block address is read straight out of the main loop's own literal,
  which gives the shift for free;
* the overlay values come from the overlay table.

This means an untested revision either resolves cleanly or fails the sanity
checks - it cannot silently produce a subtly wrong build.

# than in ARM9, so its entry names one: overlay 68, MoveRelearner_Main. It has no
# static OverlayManagerTemplate to take over - launch_application.c builds that on
# the stack - so it is matched on the live exec pointer instead.
#
# Overlay code MOVES between regions, unlike ARM9 code, so the address is found by
