@ 1ScreenHGSS - resident hook code, injected into unused ITCM.
@
@ HGSS's ARM9 autoload list puts only 0x620 bytes into ITCM (32 KB at
@ 0x01FF8000), leaving ~31 KB free. We claim it with a third autoload entry, so
@ this code is resident from boot, never unloaded, and never touched by the BSS
@ clear. Thumb BL reaches it from ARM9 and from every overlay.

@ --- Region-resolved addresses ---------------------------------------------
@ ARM9 *code* addresses are identical across HGSS regions - verified by finding
@ the same anchors at the same addresses in French and US HeartGold. Only data,
@ BSS and overlay bases move, uniformly (US = FR - 0x20).
@
@ So rather than ship one payload per region, the six address-valued constants
@ live in OneScreen_Config below, which the patcher fills in from the ROM it is
@ patching. The DEF_ values are the French ones, so an unconfigured payload is
@ still correct for French.
@ The "state block" is pret's `struct System gSystem` (include/system.h), at
@ 0x021D112C in the French ROMs. Every address below is a field of it, and the
@ layout cross-checks perfectly against what was measured empirically:
@     +0x00  GFIntrCB vBlankIntr    each app installs its own, so it identifies

@
@ Battle phase. The game has no "is the player choosing?" flag, so this reads a
@ proxy, found empirically by savestate intersection and only later identified
@ with the decomp. It is pret's poke_overlay.c:
@
@     typedef struct PMiLoadedOverlay { FSOverlayID id; BOOL active; };
@     static PMiLoadedOverlay sOverlayRegions[OVY_REGION_NUM][OVY_MAX_PER_REGION];
@
@ and specifically main-region slot 3's overlay id. The battle loads a different
@ overlay for each phase, so that one word tracks the phase:
@     0x0A  overlay 10 - the command menu / move list
@     0x08  overlay 8  - a sub-screen (bag category, item list, party)
@     0x07  overlay 7  - the turn is executing
@     0x1B  a stale id left over from before the battle; the slot is inactive
@ Testing NEGATIVELY - awaiting a command unless it reads 0x07 - covers every
@ waiting sub-state including ones we never enumerated, and it flips the instant
@ the turn machinery loads overlay 7, so the swap is not late.
@
@ Rejected on the way: 0x02111930 reads 0x06 both when a command has been
@ confirmed AND while a sub-screen is up, so it threw the scene back on top the
@ moment you went a level deeper into the bag. 0x021E17C4 and 0x02134F15 lag -
@ they only change once the turn is already under way, which looks late.
@
@ The caveat that matters: this says which overlay is RESIDENT, not whether the
@ menu is accepting input. Overlay 10 is already loaded while the battle intro
@ text is still playing, so "awaiting a command" goes true early. See the A
@ handling in OneScreen_AutoBattle, which is what stops that mattering.

@ --- The top-screen command menu -------------------------------------------
@ Offsets into the live battle structs, all reached from the BattleSystem the
@ battle app's exec trampoline hands us. Taken from pret's headers, and the ones
@ that matter are pinned by fields the decomp named after their own offsets:
@
@   struct BattleSystem (include/battle/battle.h:527)
@       +0x04 BgConfig *bgConfig      \ both confirmed independently in the retail
@       +0x08 Window   *window        / ov12: `ldr r0,[r4,#4]` / `ldr r1,[r4,#8]`
@       +0x19C BattleInput *battleInput   (unk17C[2] before it, unk1A0 after)
@
@   struct BattleInput (include/battle/battle_input.h:169)
@       +0x66B s8 curMenuId       (unused_668, unused_669 before; unk66F after)
@       +0x6B4 BattleMenuCursor { u8 enabled; s8 menuY; s8 menuX; u8 unused; }
@
@ Both offsets are 0x20 HIGHER than walking pret's struct suggests, which is the
@ drift battle_input.h:168 warns about ("at some point here my counting was off
@ so some of the listed offsets may be wrong"). Reading the computed 0x66B gave a
@ zero byte, and a 160-byte window around it contained no menu id at all.
@
@ The real values were measured out of the ROM instead of guessed. Offsets this
@ large cannot be reached by a Thumb immediate, so every access to these fields
@ has to load the offset from a literal pool - which makes the pool a census of
@ the struct. Scanning ov12's word-aligned literals in [0x500,0x800) shows:
@
@     0x68a x9   0x68b x6   0x68c x5   0x68d x1   0x68e x3   0x68f x2
@
@ six consecutive single-byte offsets, which is exactly pret's run of six u8
@ fields - battlerType, curMenuId, monTargetType, gender, isTouchDisabled,
@ unk66F. What confirms the alignment rather than merely fitting it: 0x688 and
@ 0x689 are absent from the pool entirely, and those are the two pret calls
@ unused_668 / unused_669. Unreferenced fields leave no literals.
@
@ The same +0x20 lands the cursor on 0x6d4, and the fields after it corroborate:
@ 0x6d8 (keyPressed, x8), 0x6dc (tutorial.finger, x7), 0x6e4/0x6e8/0x6ec (the
@ three ManagedSprite pointers that close the struct, x5/x1/x2). Two fields
@ agreeing on one delta, with the gaps in the right places.
@
@ Identical in IPGF, IPKF and IPKE - these are code-derived, so unlike data they
@ do not move between regions.

@ unused ones missing; menuCursor has no such signature, and three candidates
@ (0x6d4, 0x6d8, 0x6dc) all have plausible reference counts and plausible
@ neighbours. Picking one and shipping it is how the highlight ended up welded to
@ ATTAQUE: a wrong offset reads bytes that clamp to menuY 0, which is the whole
@ top row.
@
@ So BI_CURSOR_OFF is only a starting guess, and the hook corrects it from the
@ game itself - see OneScreen_BattleLearn. The window it watches has to contain
@ every candidate.

@ enum BattleMenuID (include/constants/battle_menu.h:58). Ids 1..8 are ALL the
@ root command menu, not just the two the enum bothers to name: sBattleMenuTemplates

@ sTouchscreenRectMainMenuButtons and BattleInput_CursorMove_MainMenu, and 3 and 4
@ differ from 1 and 2 only in calling BattleInput_CreateMainMenuObjects instead of
@ ...Initial - which is to say they are the "put the menu back up" states you land
@ on after backing out of the move list or the bag. 5 and 6 get named outright in
@ the cursor mover's own switch.
@
@ Testing only 1 and 2 is what made backing out of a submenu leave the screens
@ swapped with no labels: the menu was up, we just did not recognise the id.

@ BattleInput_CursorMove_TwoOptionsMenu, whose cursor is one column by two rows
@ (BattleCursor_CheckKeyInput(cursor, 1, 2, ...)), so menuY alone picks the
@ answer. The bottom screen words them differently each time - "Changer de
@ Pokemon" against "Continuer le combat" - but the choice underneath is always

@ absolute destination addresses. More than one geometry can point at the same
@ image data: the battle and field Oui/Non boxes use the same pixels at different
@ MAIN-engine character addresses. The hook carries no dimensions of its own,
@ so moving or resizing a box is a change to onescreen/labels.py alone.
@
@ An image is named by a single byte, (set << 4) | index, which is what bt_drawn
@ and bt_lock hold. The last image of each set is all paper and takes that box
@ down - a separate box for the yes/no prompt is the whole point, because the

@ Pokedex area map. The species grid and the per-Pokemon detail level share one
@ app callback and the same POWCNT1 value, so neither app_table nor a scan for a
@ sub-state byte could separate them - two candidates were tried from savestate
@ diffs and both turned out to be noise.
@
@ pret/pokeheartgold settled it. The Pokedex is an OverlayManager application:
@
@     struct OverlayManager { OverlayManagerTemplate template;  // init/exec/exit/ovy_id
@                             int exec_state;                   // +0x10
@                             int proc_state;                   // +0x14
@                             void *args; void *data; ... };
@
@ and the framework calls template.exec(manager, &manager->proc_state) every
@ frame. So instead of hunting for the state in RAM, we take over that exec
@ pointer: r1 arrives holding &proc_state, which IS the screen level. Measured
@ across four savestates covering two different Pokemon:
@     11  species grid
@     69  detail level, where the area map is on engine B (the bottom screen)
@ 69 also has its own struct in the decomp (PokedexAppData_UnkSub0868_State69),
@ which corroborates it being a real distinct screen.
@
@ Swapping on 69 alone made the map fade in on the BOTTOM screen and then jump
@ across once it was fully visible. The decomp shows why: 69 is not where the map
@ is built. PokedexApp_MainSeq_68 builds it, starts a fade in from black, and
@ hands off to MainSeq_03 - the shared "wait for the palette fade" state, which
@ returns to whatever unk_085C names. Only when the fade has finished does 68
@ return 69. So the whole visible fade-in happens under states 68 and 03.
@
@ Two consequences for the rule below:
@   * the map screen is a RANGE of states, not just 69. 69 is the idle screen,
@     70 fades back out, and 71..75 handle scrolling between maps and the
@     sub-interactions - all of them return to 69.
@   * states 02 and 03 are the shared fade waits, entered from BOTH sides, so
@     they say nothing about which screen we are on and must not be treated as
@     "not the map". They hold the current routing instead.
@
@ Acting during the build also makes the swap invisible: the map fades in FROM
@ black, so the previous screen has already faded out and both engines are black
@ at the moment we flip. Same reason the menus never flashed.
@
@ Which state does the building depends on how you got there, and this is what a
@ first attempt at 68 alone still flashed on:
@
@     from another tab   91 (or 78 / 81) fades out -> 03 -> returns 68
@     from the species grid              64 / 15   -> 03 -> returns 66
@
@ and MainSeq_66 sets up and then **tail-calls PokedexApp_MainSeq_68 directly**:
@
@     static int PokedexApp_MainSeq_66(PokedexAppData *app) {
@         ...
@         return PokedexApp_MainSeq_68(app);
@     }
@
@ so on that path the map is built and the fade started while proc_state still
@ reads 66, and the value 68 is never seen until the fade has already finished.
@ Hence the range starts at 66. Both routes into 66 come after a fade to black
@ (one of them also calls ZeroPalettesByBitmask), so swapping there is invisible.
@
@ 67 is the shared "fade this tab out and go back to the list" state, reached
@ from whichever tab was open, so like 02/03 it must hold rather than pick a
@ side - otherwise leaving the map threw it to the bottom before it faded.

PC_HOLD_FRAMES = 2

@ Flying. Selecting a destination on the Town Map used to leave the whole flight
@ animation on the bottom screen, and it only came back after the player walked
@ around at the far end. Savestates through the sequence show why:
@
@     before pressing A   Town Map app live, overlay 101, exec_state 2
@     just after A        same manager, exec_state 3 - the app is EXITING
@     mid-animation       app gone; gSystem.vBlankIntr is the field again
@     arrived / fixed     identical field state in both - only POWCNT1 differs
@
@ So the flight animation is drawn by the FIELD, after the Town Map app tears
@ down, and nothing restores the field's own routing when that happens: the
@ Town Map's layout is simply left in place. Nothing in FieldSystem distinguishes
@ "arrived but wrong" from "arrived and correct" - the two savestates match
@ field for field - which is the proof that no state flag can drive this. It has
@ to be the app transition.
@
@ So when an application hands the field back, put the world on top for a few
@ frames. Gated behind the X-menu latch and the script-menu check, so coming back
@ from the bag into an open menu, or into a shop list, is unaffected.
@
@ That gate was also why a first attempt at this changed nothing. Reading the
@ hook's own variables back out of the savestates - the payload signature "1SGS"
@ makes them easy to find in ITCM - showed menu_swapped stuck at 1 for the whole
@ flight and only 0 once it had corrected itself. Flying is reached THROUGH the X
@ menu, and the latch is deliberately kept across sub-apps so that a trip into
@ the bag and back leaves the menu on top. But flying does not come back to the
@ menu, it comes back to the world, so the latch has to be dropped - and Poll was
@ re-applying "menu on top" every frame, which is what put the flight animation
@ on the bottom screen in the first place.

@ for a stretch right after the town map tears down - the savestate taken just

@ Oak's speech, overlay 53. One of the applications that sets POWCNT1 nowhere at
@ all, so it simply inherits whatever routing it starts with - which left the
@ whole opening monologue inverted: the "TOUCHER" prompt on top and Oak's text
@ on the bottom, where a top-only setup cannot see it.
@
@ Its OverlayManager proc_state only counts 0..5; the real screen is
@ OakSpeechData.state (include/oaks_speech_internal.h), reached through
@ manager->data. The enum is fully named in the decomp, so the boundaries need
@ no guessing:
@
@     ...60  TELL_ME_ABOUT_YOURSELF        Oak and the text  -> engine A on top
@     61     ARE_YOU_A_GENDER              still Oak talking
@     62     WAIT_FADE_OUT_TO_ASK_GENDER   the fade INTO the picker
@     63-65  SETUP / WAIT_FADE_IN / HANDLE_INPUT of the gender menu
@     66-72  ASK_CONFIRM_GENDER and its yes/no
@     93     CONFIRM_GENDER_YES
@     94+    PROMPT_NAME...                 back to Oak, then the naming screen,
@                                           which app_table already handles
@
@ Swapping over 62..93 puts the boy/girl cards up while leaving the speech
@ itself alone, and starting at 62 rather than 63 means the flip happens during
@ the game's own fade-out - the same rule the Pokedex map needed.
@ The opening tutorial menu - INFOS COMMANDES / INFOS AVENTURE / NON MERCI -
@ needs the same treatment, and the window templates say so outright:
@
@     sMultichoiceMenuButtonWindowTemplates[][].bgId = GF_BG_LYR_SUB_0
@     sFullScreenMsgWindowTemplate.bgId             = GF_BG_LYR_MAIN_0
@
@ The three buttons are on engine B, and the INFOS pages they lead to are on
@ engine A. So the menu swaps and the pages do not, which is exactly the split
@ that was wanted. States 0..7 cover it: 1..3 raise and run the menu, 4..6 fade
@ it out into a topic, and 7 fades it back in when the topic returns.
@ Oak's own two-option prompts. OakSpeechData is decompiled
@ (include/oaks_speech_internal.h), and its OakSpeechMultichoice sits inline at
@ +0x160 - anchored by filler_148[0x18] immediately before it, and by unk_080 and
@ unk_114 earlier in the struct, all three named after their own offsets:
@
@     +0x160 unk_0        +0x161 numOptions
@     +0x162 inPadMode    +0x163 cursorPos
@
@ so the count and the live selection are one struct away from the pointer the
@ exec trampoline is already handed every frame. That pairing is what the field
@ prompt never had, and it is why this one is tractable.
@
@ The states come from the enum in src/oaks_speech.c, and only the three that
@ actually take input are drawn on - the setup and fade states around them would
@ otherwise flash a prompt the player cannot answer yet.

@   palette 12  the field dialogue box

@ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
@ void OneScreen_SetSwap(int swapped)
@   r0 == 0 -> engine A to the TOP screen
@   r0 != 0 -> engine A to the BOTTOM, engine B to the top
@
@ Note what this does NOT mean. It is tempting to read r0 = 1 as "bring the touch
@ UI up", and that is true for most apps only because they happen to draw their
@ touch UI on engine B. The PC box is the counter-example: stock HGSS runs
@ `POWCNT1 &= ~0x8000` there, putting engine B on TOP, which means its box grid
@ is on engine A. Passing 1 for the PC shoved the grid back down and undid the
@ static flip that had already put it on top. Always establish which engine an
@ app actually draws on before choosing a value.
@
@ This writes POWCNT1 directly, which is why callers have to re-apply it every
@ frame while a menu is up. The game routes screens through
@
@     void GfGfx_SwapDisplay(void) {          // src/gf_gfx_planes.c

@     }
@
@ so any app that calls it stamps its own idea of the routing back over ours -
@ exactly the "sub-screens re-assert the routing" behaviour worked around below.
@ Setting gSystem.screensFlipped (+0x69) instead would be the game-native way to
@ do this and would not need re-applying. Not changed here because the current
@ approach is tested and shipping; see docs/AUDIT.md before reworking it.

@ void OneScreen_BattleMenu(int image)
@
@ Blit one of the label images into the battle message window. This is the whole
@ renderer: the labels were rasterised from the ROM's own strings and font at
@ patch time, so at runtime there is no font, no heap and no call into game code
@ - just tiles copied into VRAM the game has already allocated, mapped and
@ palettised for its own message box.
@
@ The destination is window[0] on GF_BG_LYR_MAIN_1, whose tiles are contiguous
@ per row and stride by the full 27-tile window width between rows. Those row
@ offsets are precomputed in the blob header, so this is four flat copies.
@
@ Called every frame while the menu is up, for the same reason SetSwap is: the
@ game rewrites this window whenever it prints, so the last write in the frame
@ has to be ours. 1792 bytes a frame.

@ the Pokedex, PC box, fly map and Oak's speech already use. The battle is the
@ awkward one to find: every other application puts init/exec/exit *inside* the
@ overlay they name, but the battle's three are thin ARM9 wrappers (pret's
@ src/launch_application.c), so regions.find_overlay_template needs its
@ arm9_resident shape - three Thumb ARM9 pointers followed by `ovy_id == 12`.
@ Exactly one match in IPGF, IPKF and IPKE (FR/HG-FR 0x020FA468, US 0x020FA484),
@ with identical code pointers in all three, so this is region-neutral like the
@ rest.
@
@ What it is for: manager->data is the live BattleSystem, which is the root for
@ everything the top-screen command menu needs - the window it draws into, the
@ menu the player is on, and the cursor cell to highlight. Reading it here beats
@ hunting for it in RAM: the framework hands us the manager every frame.
@
@ Ordering follows OneScreen_OakExec: run the app's real exec FIRST, then read
@ manager->data. Two reasons - the pointer does not exist until Battle_Init has
@ run, and anything we draw has to land after the game's own window redraw for
@ the frame, or it gets painted over. `docs/AUDIT.md:133` calls that failure
@ class 4, and it is the reason the PC box needed a hold.
@
@ Nothing is drawn yet; this only captures the pointer, so the build is
@ behaviourally identical until the renderer lands.

@ int OneScreen_PcExec(OverlayManager *manager, int *proc_state)
@
@ The PC box (overlay 14), installed the same way as the Pokedex trampoline.
@
@ Overlay 14 is one of the 75 the decomp has not reached, so there is no state
@ machine to read - the screen levels came from savestates instead. Reading
@ proc_state out of the live manager at each of them:
@
@     inside a box, cursor on a Pokemon    81
@     inside a box, holding a Pokemon     115
@     item storage                        117
@     fading in / fading out                0   (exec_state 2 / 3)
@
@ and, the useful part, the PC option list ("DEPOT POKEMON" / "MON PC" / ...)
@ has NO overlay-14 manager at all - checked both before entering and after
@ backing out. That list is a field menu; the app only exists once you are
@ inside. So the whole of overlay 14 is "managing the box", and every screen in
@ it wants engine B on top. There is nothing to distinguish, and no per-state
@ rule to get wrong.
@
@ The direction here was wrong twice before it was measured properly. Overlay 14
@ has exactly one POWCNT1 site, and disassembling it in the stock ROM settles
@ which engine the box is on:
@
@     stock     ldr r0,=0xFFFF7FFF ; ands r0,r1 ; strh   ->  clears bit 15
@     patched   ldr r0,=0x00008000 ; orrs r0,r1 ; strh   ->  sets   bit 15
@
@ So stock HGSS puts engine B on the TOP screen for the PC, which means the box
@ grid - the half you actually operate - is drawn on engine A. The static site
@ flip already turns that into "engine A on top", i.e. the grid on top, and it
@ needs no help. Forcing r0 = 1 here, on the assumption that the touch UI must
@ be on engine B like everywhere else, pushed the grid straight back down and
@ undid the flip.
@
@ What remains is only insurance against something re-routing later in the
@ frame: run the app first, then re-assert the SAME direction the flipped site
@ already chose, and arm a countdown so OneScreen_Frame keeps doing it from
@ where the battle logic writes from. Everything now agrees - the flipped site,
@ GfGfx_SwapDisplay with screensFlipped = 0, and us.
@
@ Coming out is self-healing: the countdown lapses and the field re-asserts.

@ Writing POWCNT1 ourselves is not enough for every app. GfGfx_SwapDisplay reads
@ this byte and re-derives the routing from it, and it can be reached from a
@ VBlank callback - i.e. after everything the main loop does - so a direct
@ POWCNT1 write can be undone later in the same frame no matter where we put it.
@ Overlay 14 has only ONE POWCNT1 site of its own, and gSystem.screensFlipped
@ reads 0 in every PC savestate, so that is exactly what was happening: forcing
@ POWCNT1 every frame from two different places still lost.
@
@ Setting the flag instead makes the game route the way we want on its own, from
@ wherever it re-asserts. Every entry in sMapLoadModes has switchScreens = FALSE,
@ so the game only ever drives this to 0; nothing else fights us for it, and a
@ map change will reset it for free.

@
@ reached as sFieldSysPtr -> fieldSystem->taskman (+0x10). The struct confirms
@ itself: +0x18 reads back the FieldSystem pointer we started from.
@
@ Measured across three savestates:
@     X menu open   taskman 0x022C01D8, func 0x0203BEF1  <- ARM9: Task_StartMenu
@     no menu       taskman NULL
@     after Dig     taskman 0x022C01D8, func 0x0224C3CD  <- an OVERLAY: a script
@
@ Two facts are used, and only these two:
@
@   * taskman == NULL means the field is idle, so a press of X will actually
@     open the menu. That is the game's own gate, which is why a ladder swallows
@     the press.
@   * an OVERLAY-resident task means a script owns the field. Scripts live in
@     overlays; the menu lives in ARM9.
@
@ What is NOT safe is the converse - reading "func is in ARM9" as "the menu is
@ open". That was tried and broke several things at once: the cave-name card and
@ the flight sequence are ARM9 field tasks too, so the menu was forced over both.
@ ARM9 means "not a script", nothing more.

@ Draw the overworld menu onto the world itself, on GF_BG_LYR_MAIN_3.
@
@ Every other box this patch draws borrows a message window the game has already
@ created, so the tiles are allocated, mapped and palettised and drawing is a
@ memcpy. The overworld has no such window - the world fills the screen - so this
@ is the one place that writes a TILEMAP as well as pixels.
@
@ It needs no display registers touched at all: MAIN_3 is priority 0 and the 3D
@ world is BG0 at priority 1 (initializeSimple3DVramManager, gf_3d_render.c:46),
@ so the panel is already in front. The strips sit at tile 0x90 - clear of the
@ 130 tiles the menu loads for itself at tile 0, and far below the map-name
@ window at 0x197, the only permanently allocated window on this layer.
@
@ They are re-uploaded on every open rather than once, because a script list menu
@ parks its own tiles at 0x3D..0xDD and eats into ours while the menu is shut.
@ 5 KB once per press of X is nothing, and it removes a whole class of bug.
@
@ Highlighting costs no pixels: the selected cell's tilemap entries are written
@ with a different palette number. That is how the game's own menu does it too -
@ ov27_0225B398 reloads a palette rather than moving a cursor sprite - and it is
@ what keeps this affordable, since one finished image per highlighted entry
@ would have been 32 KB against 11 KB of free ITCM.

@ void OneScreen_Unpack(r0 = packed stream, r1 = destination)
@
@ LZ77 over 32-bit words, the format onescreen/labels.py::_pack writes. Words
@ rather than bytes because DS VRAM ignores byte writes: a byte decoder would
@ have to hold a pending half of each halfword and read its own output back to
@ resolve matches. In words every literal and every match is a `str`, and matches
@ read back with `ldr` - nothing subtle, which matters for the only routine here
@ that writes VRAM from a variable-length input.
@
@ Literals are assembled from four `ldrb`. The stream is byte-packed, so a
@ literal word is rarely 4-byte aligned, and an `ldr` on a misaligned address
@ rotates rather than faults - it would silently read the right bytes in the
@ wrong order.
@
@ Overlapping matches are deliberate: a displacement of one word copied forward
@ repeats that word, which is how runs of paper cost two bytes per 72.

@ void OneScreen_MirrorRect(r0 = tilemap address, r1 = rows, r2 = columns)
@
@ Copy a rectangle of MAIN_3's tilemap out of VRAM and into the game's own
@ shadow copy of it, so the next time the game commits that copy it repaints what
@ we drew instead of erasing it. See "Who owns the VRAM you just drew into".
@
@ Done as a copy after the fact rather than by writing both destinations inside
@ the drawing loops: those loops have no spare registers, and this leaves code
@ that has already been play-tested completely untouched.

@ void OneScreen_Intro(void)
@ Put the opening cinematic's two misrouted scenes on the right screen.
@
@ The intro is overlay 60 running four scene functions in turn. Two of them show
@ their content on the lower LCD, and they need OPPOSITE corrections - scene B
@ wants engine B raised, the tail of scene A wants engine A raised - so each
@ carries its own value rather than a shared "swap".
@
@ Scene A is the awkward one. Its first half is correct and its second half is
@ not, and the two are indistinguishable: diffing the whole 512-byte scene block
@ between a good frame and a bad one leaves exactly ONE differing byte, a frame
@ counter. So this is the one place in the patch driven by elapsed time. That is
@ defensible for a cinematic, whose scenes really are defined by time rather than
@ by state, but it is a hardcoded number and worth knowing about. The changeover
@ is taken on a frame where both screens are black, so being a frame out either
@ way is invisible.
@
@ Everything fails closed: no resolved address, no data pointer, or a pointer
@ outside main RAM, and the intro simply plays as it did before.
